# Project Overview – SyntaxBase

This document provides an overview of the **SyntaxBase** project, including the problems it addresses, its core goals, key features, and planned next steps for future development.

## What is SyntaxBase?

**SyntaxBase** is a full-stack learning and collaboration platform that combines structured educational content with real-time interaction and community features.  
The project showcases a **microservices architecture** powered by **Spring Boot**, **React**, **Kafka**, **WebSockets**, and **PostgreSQL**, all wrapped in **Dockerized deployments**.

---

## Core Learning Sections

SyntaxBase provides a wide range of tutorials, exercises, and interactive content organized into **five core domains**:

- **Web Development**
- **Game Development**
- **Database Management**
- **Problem Solving**
- **Instructions & Lectures**

Each domain is structured into **three tiers**—**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**—to guide learners through progressive skill levels.

---

## Community Features

Beyond learning materials, SyntaxBase offers collaboration through an integrated **community forum** where users can:

- **Engage in discussions** – threaded forum with topic sections, message editing, and user profile previews.
- **Connect with peers** – one-to-one chat and discovery of other developers and tech enthusiasts.
- **Share feedback** – receive guidance from instructors or collaborate with fellow learners.

## Problem It Solves

Many e-learning and collaboration platforms face common challenges:
- Limited **real-time interaction** between participants.
- Tightly coupled architectures that make systems harder to extend.
- Fragmented user experience across chat, notifications, and content delivery.
- Lack of a unified technical foundation to support both learning content and community features.

**SyntaxBase** approaches these challenges by:
- Introducing **WebSockets** for live notifications and chat.
- Using **Kafka** to demonstrate event-driven, decoupled communication between services.
- Structuring the backend into **modular microservices** rather than a monolith.
- Combining a **modern UI (React)** with a reliable **backend core (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)**.

*Note: While the architecture is designed with scalability in mind, the primary goal of this project is to demonstrate modern engineering practices, experiment with new technologies and provide a complete end-to-end system. Production-grade performance testing has not been performed, but future work and commits may include scalability testing and optimization.*

## Goals of the Project

1. **Demonstrate modular and scalable architecture** with microservices, message queues, and real-time connections.
2. **Provide a complete end-to-end app** — backend, frontend, database, communication middleware, and deployment pipeline.
3. **Serve as a flagship portfolio project**, showcasing good engineering practices (layered backend design, unit testing, Dockerization).
4. **Highlight advanced features** such as event-driven communication and live user interactions.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Management** – registration, login, role-based access
- **Real-time Chat** – WebSocket-based messaging between users
- **Live Notifications** – Kafka + WebSockets power event-driven updates
- **Content / Lesson Management** – courses, lessons, and structured content delivery
- **Collaboration Tools** – interaction features for students and teachers
- **Scalable Microservices** – modular backend services that can be extended independently
- **Dockerized Deployment** – simplified setup with containers
- **Unit Tests** – validation of backend services and core flows

*(In [FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md](./FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md), screenshots illustrate these features in detail.)*

## Next Steps

- Explore scalability improvements, including load balancing and Kafka partitioning.
- Add advanced learning features such as grading and analytics.
- Enhance observability with improved monitoring, logging, and metrics.
- Refine UX/UI for smoother workflows and better user experience.

### Future Community Enhancements
- Implement forum comment moderation with a separate NLP module for detecting and handling toxic content.
- Integrate AI-assisted comment classification to help administrators manage user interactions more effectively.
